 This folder is a directory used to organize and store static files for the project, such as images, fonts, icons, 
 or any other resources that don't require server-side processing. This helps maintain a clean and structured project setup.
 
 The js folder includes a live_update.js file, which enables the site to fetch live updates for the chart directly from the database, 
 ensuring real-time data representation.
