The models directory contains files that define the data structure and business logic for the application. 
It typically includes schema definitions for our databases and methods for interacting with the data, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. 

Note: Some functions in the Models may appear redundant, as not all of them are actively used. This is due to challenges in maintaining and updating the codebase.
